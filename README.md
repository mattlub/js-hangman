# js Hangman
js Hangman is a javascript hangman app I created.
Try it out [here](https://mattlub.github.io/js-hangman/)

### Motivations
I wanted to practise using vanilla js to make AJAX requests and also to create a (relatively) well-structured modular app.

### Useful things learnt
- making modular code
- power of closures
- CSS: outline:none on input/button when focused

### Planned Improvements
- [x] major stylisation (DONE 15/11/16)
- [ ] add actual hangman animation
- [ ] actually make API functional
- [x] add a few random words to select between if API doesn't work (DONE 15/11/16)
- [x] add link to word definition if you lose (DONE 15/11/16)
- [x] add reset function which empties all contents of div (DONE: 14/11/16)
- [ ] add options variable to initialisation of the app, including e.g. word length and starting lives.
- [ ] 15/11/16: make responsive, and for mobile (e.g. hover animations not useful)
- [ ] 15/11/16: make new game button flash when game over
- [ ] 15/11/16: move hangman app to separate file

### Collaboration
Any collaboration is welcome, especially some CSS wizardry on my example so it looks a little better ;)
