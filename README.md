# js Hangman
-------------------
js Hangman is a basic hangman app I created. Try it out!

##### Motivations
-------------------
I wanted to practise using vanilla js to make AJAX requests and also to create a (relatively) well-structured modular app.

##### Planned Improvements
-------------------
- major stylisation
- add actual hangman animation
- actually make API functional
- add link to word definition if you lose
- add reset function which empties all contents of div
- add options variable to initialisation of the app, including e.g. word length and starting lives.

##### Collaboration
-------------------
Any collaboration is welcome, especially some CSS wizardry on my example so it looks a little better ;)
